## Desktop Duplication PoC
Needed a small Lib/utility to capture the screen if it's changed using the Desktop Duplication API.
Not thoroughly tested, use at your own risk.

## Examples
- [example1](./example1/) - small exe to record the screen, dumps BMPs to `%WINDIR%\temp\ddx`
- [example2](./example2/) - more or less the same written in C#
